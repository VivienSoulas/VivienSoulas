# Hi, I'm Vivien 🌀

**Software engineering student at Ecole 42 Amsterdam (Codam)** with a track record of precision and problem-solving from previous professional experience. Now channeling that rigor into building robust systems from scratch.

I'm mastering low-level programming—memory management, concurrency, graphics rendering—while actively exploring **cybersecurity** (TryHackMe, HackTheBox).  
→ I don't just want code to work; I want to understand *why* it works and where it breaks.

**What I bring:** The discipline to debug complex systems, the curiosity to understand fundamentals deeply, and the drive to build reliable software.
